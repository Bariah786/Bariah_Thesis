### Abstract

Clouds in Antarctica exert a significant influence on the climate system, both directly
at high southern latitudes and indirectly globally, as local circulation shifts contribute
to global teleconnections. In this paper, we will set the basis to test some common
cloud cover parameterizations and can also compare our results to observed cloud cover.
Some independent variables (e.g., emissivity and transmissivity) must be determined to
test these parameterizations. The output of a Neumayer station (temperature at 2m,
shortwave radiation downward and longwave radiation downward) for the period 2010
to 2018 is analyzed to derive emissivity and transmissivity. The results of these analyses
revealed that the majority of the days at Neumayer are overcast, and there is no seasonality
in emissivity, transmissivity, and cloud cover. We can also compare our findings to those
of other Antarctic stations later in the thesis to see if there are any similarities. Despite
regional differences in Antarctic cloud cover, we expect statistics, such as the link between
emissivity and transmissivity, to stay consistent.
